That version is pre homestead version 

 Ethereum(J) is the library that can be embedded in any Java/Scala project
 and to provide full support for Ethereum protocol and sub services.a
 

##### Pure Java Miner 

We support mining now! It is currently implemented in pure Java and can 
be used in private and test networks. You may even mine on the live Ethereum
network however it is not economically feasible of course. 

The miner can run in two modes ‘cache-only’ and ‘full-dataset’. For the same 
difficulty the first one requires much more time to calculate a block nonce but 
takes only 16Mb of RAM while the latter takes 1Gb but runs much faster. The 
first one can be used for testing with lowered difficulty.

The mining can be started by ‘mine.start’ config option which makes the miner started 
either immediately on startup or when the blockchain is synced with the network. Another
option is starting the miner programmatically by invoking `Ethereum.getBlockMiner().startMining()`. 
To monitor miner events you may want to implement and add `MinerListener`

The `PrivateMinerSample` demonstrates creation of a simple 2 peer private network with a miner.
